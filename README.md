# **HTML CSS Git Challenge**: *Code Refactor*
This is my first weekly challenge for the UCF Coding Boot Camp. The following challenge is expressed in the form of an on-the-job ticket and the focus is accessibility. I was given a starter code with HTML and CSS and a mockup of the website for visual reference.

## **Challenge:**
__AS A__ marketing agency
__I WANT__ a codebase that follows accessibility standards
__SO THAT__ our own site is optimized for search engines.

### **Guidelines** ###
__GIVEN a webpage meets accessibility standards:__

* _WHEN I view the source code_
* _THEN I find semantic HTML elements_
* _WHEN I view the structure of the HTML elements_
* _THEN I find that the elements follow a logical structure independent of styling and positioning_
* _WHEN I view the image elements_
* _THEN I find accessible alt attributes_
* _WHEN I view the heading attributes_
* _THEN they fall in sequential order_
* _WHEN I view the title element_
* _THEN I find a concise, descriptive title_
